Code Analysis Report and Key Findings
Project Overview

Project Name: Seafile Server
File Analyzed: password-hash.c
Line Number: 144
Issue Type: Information Exposure (CWE-200)
Risk Level: Medium

Key Findings
1. Vulnerability Description

Location: common/password-hash.c, Line 144
Issue: Sensitive information (hash algorithms and parameters) is logged in plaintext, potentially exposing internal implementation details.
CWE Reference: CWE-200: Information Exposure
2. Impact

Logging sensitive details could allow attackers to:
Identify the cryptographic algorithms used.
Exploit weaknesses in the hashing algorithm.
Gather internal system details for potential attacks.
Code Snippet (Before Fix)
  seaf_message("password hash algorithms: %s, params: %s\n", params->algo, params->params_str);

 Fixed Code
#ifdef DEBUG
    seaf_message("password hash algorithms: %s, params: %s\n", params->algo, params->params_str);
#else
    seaf_message("password hash algorithms: [REDACTED], params: [REDACTED]\n");
#endif

Explanation:
In debug builds, the sensitive information is logged for debugging purposes.
In production builds, sensitive information is replaced with [REDACTED].
5. Steps Taken to Resolve

Identified the problematic logging in password-hash.c.
Replaced sensitive logging with conditional debugging.
Ensured sensitive data is not logged in production environments.
6. Recommendations

Regularly audit the codebase for similar vulnerabilities.
Avoid logging sensitive details such as passwords, keys, and algorithms unless absolutely necessary.
Use logging frameworks that support different logging levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, ERROR).
7. Testing

Verified the fix by building and running the application.
Checked logs to confirm:
Debug Mode: Full sensitive information is logged as expected.
Production Mode: Sensitive details are replaced with [REDACTED].
Summary
The issue in password-hash.c was an information exposure vulnerability due to improper logging of sensitive information. The fix ensures that sensitive details are logged only in debug mode and hidden in production builds, mitigating the risk of exposing internal details to attackers.
