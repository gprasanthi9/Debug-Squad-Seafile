# **Software Security Engineering: Requirements for Seafile**

## **Part 1: Use/Misuse Case Analysis**

To conduct a thorough security analysis of Seafile, we’ve identified critical system features and their associated actors and enabling systems. Each of these features plays a pivotal role in the system’s functionality, and our analysis includes comprehensive use case and misuse case diagrams. These diagrams outline existing functionalities while incorporating security considerations to address potential vulnerabilities and threats. We've identified five main features as the focal points of our analysis:

1. **File Version Control**:  
   This feature ensures users can manage and track changes across different versions of files, maintaining integrity and history.
   
2. **Data Synchronization**:  
   Seafile’s data synchronization capability allows users to sync files across multiple devices, ensuring consistency and accessibility of data.

3. **File Upload/Download**:  
   This feature provides users with the ability to securely upload and download files, safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality during transfers.

4. **User Login**:  
   Users authenticate their credentials to gain access to Seafile, ensuring secure access to the system and protecting sensitive information.

5. **File Sharing**:  
   Users can share files securely with others, controlling who can access shared content and ensuring sensitive data is protected during sharing.

### Assessment:

The **file upload and download** feature in Seafile is a vital component, allowing users to manage file transfers securely. However, there are potential risks such as **data tampering** and **data theft**, especially if a malicious user gains unauthorized access to the system.

To mitigate these risks, Seafile implements **access control** mechanisms that ensure only authorized users can upload or download files. This limits the ability of unauthorized individuals to interfere with file management. **AES-256 encryption** is employed to protect files during transmission, ensuring that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable to attackers.

The system also incorporates **file validation** processes to ensure that files being uploaded are safe and free from malicious content. Any harmful files are blocked from entering the system, protecting users from potential malware.

Furthermore, **logging and monitoring activities** provide visibility into all file actions, enabling administrators to track and detect any abnormal behavior, such as unauthorized data access or suspicious downloads. These logs help prevent **data tampering** by alerting administrators to unauthorized changes.

To add another layer of security, **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** is enforced during the upload and download processes. This ensures that even if an attacker obtains login credentials, they cannot perform file operations without the second authentication factor.

Lastly, the integration of **file version control** ensures that any modifications or deletions can be tracked and reverted, preventing permanent damage from tampering. The system also mitigates data theft through encryption and controlled access, ensuring sensitive data remains protected.
