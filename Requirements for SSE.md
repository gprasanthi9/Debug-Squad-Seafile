# **Software Security Engineering: Requirements for Seafile**

## **Part 1: Use/Misuse Case Analysis**

To conduct a thorough security analysis of Seafile, we’ve identified critical system features and their associated actors and enabling systems. Each of these features plays a pivotal role in the system’s functionality, and our analysis includes comprehensive use case and misuse case diagrams. These diagrams outline existing functionalities while incorporating security considerations to address potential vulnerabilities and threats. We've identified five main features as the focal points of our analysis:

1. **File Version Control**:  
   This feature ensures users can manage and track changes across different versions of files, maintaining integrity and history.
   
2. **Data Synchronization**:  
   Seafile’s data synchronization capability allows users to sync files across multiple devices, ensuring consistency and accessibility of data.

3. **File Upload/Download**:  
   This feature provides users with the ability to securely upload and download files, safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality during transfers.

4. **Admin Management**:  
   Administrators manage system configurations, roles, and permissions, ensuring the system is properly configured and secure from unauthorized access.

5. **File Sharing**:  
   Users can share files with others securely, controlling who can access shared content and ensuring that sensitive data is protected during sharing.
