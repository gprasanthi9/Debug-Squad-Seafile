**Assessment:**  
Seafile’s file upload process includes integrated malware scanning to detect and block harmful files before they are uploaded. Files are encrypted with AES-256 encryption during both upload and download, ensuring that even if intercepted, the data remains protected. Furthermore, role-based access control ensures that only authorized users can access specific files. All file upload and download activities are logged, allowing administrators to detect and respond to any suspicious actions promptly.
