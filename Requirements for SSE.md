### **1.1 User Login Use Case**

**Use Case:**  User logs in, password is hashed then multi-factor is requested to successfully login.

**Misuse Case:**  An script kiddie attacker tries to use either brute force password guess or more target credential stuffing with informaiton from an account breach. 

**Diagram:**  
![File Upload/Download Use-Misuse Case Diagram](https://github.com/gprasanthi9/Debug-Squad-Seafile/blob/main/Use-Misuse%20Case%20Diagram/User%20Login%20Use-Misuse%20Case.jpg)

**Assessment:** Under and attack scenario, if credentials are valid it still will be prevented by multi-factor.  With to many login attempts the account can be temporarily locked to slow down attack or account can be locked.  Account lockout is a form of Denial of Service.



### **1.2 File Version Control Use Case**

**Use Case:**  The File Version Control System empowers users to manage file versions efficiently by allowing them to upload new file versions and revert to previous ones when needed. It also maintains a complete history of file versions, ensuring that every modification is tracked. The system verifies user permissions before files are uploaded, ensuring that only authorized users can make changes. This enhances document management by promoting accountability and data protection, allowing teams to recover previous versions, handle upload errors, and avoid accidental loss of important data.

**Misuse Case:**  In this Misuse case, a Malicious User attempts to upload a corrupted file or maliciously overwrite existing file versions within the File Version Control System. Such actions could compromise the integrity of data or disrupt the normal workflow of the system. The system mitigates these threats by verifying file permissions and incorporating access control measures, which prevent unauthorized users from tampering with files. It also tracks and monitors file uploads to detect suspicious activities. Alerts are sent to the Admin if any unauthorized behavior is detected, ensuring timely intervention to maintain data security and workflow continuity.

**Diagram:**

**Assessment:**  
The file version control feature in Seafile allows users to manage file versions, ensuring that previous versions are preserved and recoverable. This functionality is essential in mitigating potential risks such as accidental file overwrites or unauthorized modifications. Users can revert to earlier versions of files, safeguarding critical data from accidental deletions or corruption.

To protect the system from misuse, role-based permissions and file integrity checks are enforced. This ensures that only authorized users can upload or modify files, and any corrupted or malicious uploads are detected and blocked. Additionally, the system logs and monitors all file-related activities, enabling administrators to detect suspicious behavior, such as attempts to upload corrupted files by malicious users. Alerts are generated in response to these activities to prevent data compromise or workflow disruption.



### **1.3 Data Synchronization Use Case**

**Use Case:**  The Data Synchronization feature allows users to keep their Seafile libraries up-to-date across multiple devices. The synchronization process ensures file consistency and integrity across platforms. Key actions include verifying permissions and handling upload errors. The system verifies that the user has proper permissions to perform the sync and manages any errors that occur during the process. After synchronization, the system checks whether the sync was successful and, if so, ensures files are synced across devices. If the sync fails, the system triggers error handling and recovery mechanisms.

**Misuse Case:**  A potential attacker may attempt to intercept data during the synchronization process, threatening the confidentiality of the files. This misuse case targets the Seafile Synchronization Service by attempting to intercept or corrupt data in transit. To mitigate this threat, Seafile employs End-to-End Encryption and SSL/TLS Certificate Validation to protect the communication channels and ensure that even if data is intercepted, it remains secure and unreadable to unauthorized actors.

**Diagram:**  
<img width="1177" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8d62b90-4f75-422f-b6b8-e332d053c369">

**Assessment:**  
The data synchronization process in Seafile is essential for ensuring that users' files are consistent across multiple devices. However, this process can be vulnerable to data interception and unauthorized access, particularly when a malicious actor attempts to exploit the synchronization mechanism. To address these risks, Seafile incorporates robust access control mechanisms that ensure only authorized users and devices can initiate or participate in the synchronization process. Additionally, End-to-End Encryption is employed, protecting data from being exposed to unauthorized entities even if intercepted during transmission. This ensures that any intercepted data remains unreadable to attackers.

Furthermore, Seafile implements SSL/TLS validation to secure communication channels, making it nearly impossible for attackers to insert themselves into the data exchange during synchronization. The system also incorporates logging and monitoring activities, providing administrators with visibility into all synchronization actions. This feature allows for quick detection of any unusual behavior, such as unauthorized access attempts or data interception. In case of any synchronization errors, the Handle Upload Errors process ensures that the system can recover without compromising the integrity of the files. These combined measures make the data synchronization process both reliable and secure, safeguarding user data against potential threats.

### **1.4 File Upload/Download Use Case**

**Use Case:**  Users securely upload or download files within the Seafile platform, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

**Misuse Case:**  A malicious user attempts to upload a malware-infected file or intercept sensitive data during a download.

**Diagram:**  

![File Upload/Download Use-Misuse Case Diagram](https://github.com/gprasanthi9/Debug-Squad-Seafile/blob/5af7e64a53db9244d7fad26b6dc94823bfdfed09/Use-Misuse%20Case%20Diagram/File%20Upload%20%26%20Download.jpg)





**Assessment:**  

The **file upload and download** feature in Seafile is a vital component, allowing users to manage file transfers securely. However, there are potential risks such as **data tampering** and **data theft**, especially if a malicious user gains unauthorized access to the system.

To mitigate these risks, Seafile implements **access control** mechanisms that ensure only authorized users can upload or download files. This limits the ability of unauthorized individuals to interfere with file management. **AES-256 encryption** is employed to protect files during transmission, ensuring that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable to attackers.

The system also incorporates **file validation** processes to ensure that files being uploaded are safe and free from malicious content. Any harmful files are blocked from entering the system, protecting users from potential malware.

Furthermore, **logging and monitoring activities** provide visibility into all file actions, enabling administrators to track and detect any abnormal behavior, such as unauthorized data access or suspicious downloads. These logs help prevent **data tampering** by alerting administrators to unauthorized changes.



### **1.5 File Sharing Use Case**

**Use Case:**  
In Seafile, the file sharing use case revolves around a user ( a "Researcher") sharing files or folders with others, both within and outside the organization. The process allows for seamless collaboration while maintaining tight control over access and security. Users can define specific permissions, such as read-only or editing rights, for each recipient. Files can be shared with individuals, groups, or external parties through public links, which can be password-protected and set with expiration dates.


**Misuse Case:**  
An impersonator attempted to access file with the link shared. The attacker attempted unathorizes access through various means like password guessing or brute force attack on a weak password, social engineering and malware attack to bypass outdated system.

**Diagram:**  


[![File Upload/Download Use-Misuse Case Diagram](https://github.com/gprasanthi9/Debug-Squad-Seafile/raw/main/Use-Misuse%20Case%20Diagram/File%20Sharing%20Use-Misuse%20Case.jpg)](https://github.com/gprasanthi9/Debug-Squad-Seafile/blob/main/Use-Misuse%20Case%20Diagram/File%20Sharing%20Use-Misuse%20Case.jpg)

**Assessment:**  
The file-sharing process in Seafile is a key feature that facilitates seamless collaboration among users. However, this process is susceptible to risks such as unauthorized access and data leakage, especially when files are shared externally or publicly. To mitigate these risks, Seafile incorporates stringent access control mechanisms, allowing users to define specific permissions for file-sharing activities. This ensures that only authorized individuals, whether internal or external, can view or modify shared files.

Additionally, Seafile uses End-to-End Encryption for libraries, protecting files from unauthorized access both during storage and transmission. When files are shared, particularly via public links, users can add an extra layer of security by enabling password protection and setting link expiration dates. This ensures that shared files remain secure, even if the sharing link is intercepted or accessed by unintended recipients.

Moreover, Seafile employs SSL/TLS encryption for all file-sharing communication, safeguarding data against potential man-in-the-middle attacks. The system's logging and monitoring tools provide administrators with visibility into all file-sharing actions, allowing them to quickly detect and respond to suspicious activities, such as unauthorized link access or modifications to shared files. In case of any sharing-related issues, the system ensures file integrity by logging errors and logout user with multiple login attempt, reducing the risk of data loss.
