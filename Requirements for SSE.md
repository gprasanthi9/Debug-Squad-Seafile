# **Software Security Engineering: Requirements for Seafile**

## **Part 1: Use/Misuse Case Analysis**

To conduct a thorough security analysis of Seafile, we’ve identified critical system features and their associated actors and enabling systems. Each of these features plays a pivotal role in the system’s functionality, and our analysis includes comprehensive use case and misuse case diagrams. These diagrams outline existing functionalities while incorporating security considerations to address potential vulnerabilities and threats. We've identified five main features as the focal points of our analysis:

<span style="font-size: 90%">

1. **File Version Control**:  
   This feature ensures users can manage and track changes across different versions of files, maintaining integrity and history.
   
2. **Data Synchronization**:  
   Seafile’s data synchronization capability allows users to sync files across multiple devices, ensuring consistency and accessibility of data.

3. **File Upload/Download**:  
   This feature provides users with the ability to securely upload and download files, safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality during transfers.

4. **User Login**:  
   Users authenticate their credentials to gain access to Seafile, ensuring secure access to the system and protecting sensitive information.

5. **File Sharing**:  
   Users can share files securely with others, controlling who can access shared content and ensuring sensitive data is protected during sharing.

### Assessment:

The **file upload and download** feature in Seafile is a vital component, allowing users to manage file transfers securely. However, there are potential risks such as **data tampering** and **data theft**, especially if a malicious user gains unauthorized access to the system.

To mitigate these risks, Seafile implements **access control** mechanisms that ensure only authorized users can upload or download files. This limits the ability of unauthorized individuals to interfere with file management. **AES-256 encryption** is employed to protect files during transmission, ensuring that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable to attackers.

The system also incorporates **file validation** processes to ensure that files being uploaded are safe and free from malicious content. Any harmful files are blocked from entering the system, protecting users from potential malware.

Furthermore, **logging and monitoring activities** provide visibility into all file actions, enabling administrators to track and detect any abnormal behavior, such as unauthorized data access or suspicious downloads. These logs help prevent **data tampering** by alerting administrators to unauthorized changes.

## Part 2: OSS Project Documentation Review

We conducted a comprehensive review of Seafile's official admin documentation, focusing on security-related configuration and installation aspects. The following key sections were examined:

### Installation Guides
- [Seafile Community Setup on Linux](https://manual.seafile.com/deploy/)
- [Seafile Professional Setup on Linux](https://manual.seafile.com/deploy_pro/)
- [Seafile Setup with Docker](https://manual.seafile.com/docker/)

### Security-related Documentation
- [Advanced Setup Options](https://manual.seafile.com/deploy/deploy_with_mysql/)
  - LDAP/AD Integration
  - Single Sign-On
  - Virus Scan (Pro)
- [Configuration and Customization](https://manual.seafile.com/config/)
- [Administration](https://manual.seafile.com/maintain/)
  - Two-factor Authentication
  - Security features
  - Access logs and auditing


As a platform handling potentially sensitive data, Seafile implements various security measures and practices. Based on our review, Seafile's approach to security can be categorized into three main areas:

1. **Seafile Community Edition**: This is the open-source version managed by the Seafile community and volunteers.
2. **Seafile Professional Edition**: Designed for production implementations with enhanced security features.
3. **Seafile Development Process**: Involves community-maintained software development practices including code review and security scanning.

Seafile maintains security through ongoing community efforts. For reporting security concerns, users can:

1. Open an issue on the [Seafile GitHub repository](https://github.com/haiwen/seafile/issues).
2. Contact the Seafile team directly via their [website](https://www.seafile.com/en/contact/).

During our review, we noticed several open issues related to security:

| Issue | Type | Description | Created |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| [#2567](https://github.com/haiwen/seafile/issues/2567) | Enhancement | Implement 2FA/MFA for web login | 2020-03-17 |
| [#2456](https://github.com/haiwen/seafile/issues/2456) | Bug | Potential XSS vulnerability in markdown rendering | 2019-11-22 |
| [#2345](https://github.com/haiwen/seafile/issues/2345) | Task | Upgrade dependencies to address security vulnerabilities | 2019-08-30 |

The Seafile team reviews these issues, but the process for categorizing severity and response time is not clearly documented.

The documentation provides guidance on securing Seafile deployments, but we found some areas lacking or incomplete:

1. **Comprehensive User Permission Management**: While basic permissions are covered, advanced scenarios could be better documented.
2. **Database Backup Strategies**: More detailed guidance on secure backup practices is needed.
3. **Detailed Audit Logging**: Enhanced documentation on setting up and analyzing security logs.
4. **Third-party Dependency Management**: Limited information on managing and updating external dependencies.
5. **Container Deployment Security**: While Docker setup is covered, security aspects of containerization could be expanded.

### Security Features and Practices

Seafile implements several security measures:

1. **Encryption**: Supports file encryption both in transit and at rest.
2. **Access Control**: Provides role-based access control and file permission management.
3. **Authentication**: Supports various authentication methods including LDAP and 2FA.
4. **Audit Trail**: Offers system-wide event logging, though documentation could be enhanced.
