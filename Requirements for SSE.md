# **Software Security Engineering: Requirements for Seafile**

## **Part 1: Use/Misuse Case Analysis**

To conduct a thorough security analysis of Seafile, we’ve identified critical system features and their associated actors and enabling systems. Each of these features plays a pivotal role in the system’s functionality, and our analysis includes comprehensive use case and misuse case diagrams. These diagrams outline existing functionalities while incorporating security considerations to address potential vulnerabilities and threats. We've identified five main features as the focal points of our analysis:

1. **File Version Control**:  
   This feature ensures users can manage and track changes across different versions of files, maintaining integrity and history.
   
2. **Data Synchronization**:  
   Seafile’s data synchronization capability allows users to sync files across multiple devices, ensuring consistency and accessibility of data.

3. **File Upload/Download**:  
   This feature provides users with the ability to securely upload and download files, safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality during transfers.

4. **User Login**:  
   Users authenticate their credentials to gain access to Seafile, ensuring secure access to the system and protecting sensitive information.

5. **File Sharing**:  
   Users can share files securely with others, controlling who can access shared content and ensuring sensitive data is protected during sharing.

### Assessment:

In this scenario, a malicious user is attempting to exploit the file upload and download processes within Seafile. There are two primary modes of attack: uploading malware-infected files or intercepting sensitive data during file transfers.

The first mode of attack involves the malicious user trying to upload a harmful file to the system. To prevent this, Seafile employs file validation and malware scanning, which automatically checks each file for any malicious content before it can be uploaded. This initial defense ensures that no harmful files can enter the system, protecting both users and stored data. Additionally, multi-factor authentication (MFA) ensures that only authorized users with proper credentials can access the file upload feature, further reducing the risk of unauthorized or harmful uploads.

The second mode of attack involves intercepting sensitive data during the file download process. To safeguard against this, Seafile uses AES-256 encryption for all file transfers, ensuring that even if the data is intercepted, it remains unreadable and secure. Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to limit access to sensitive files, meaning that only authorized users can download specific files. Furthermore, logging and monitoring of all file activities are in place, allowing administrators to track and respond to any unusual actions or attempts at data theft.

By implementing these security measures, Seafile mitigates the risks of data tampering and theft during file uploads and downloads. The combination of encryption, access controls, and monitoring ensures that files remain secure throughout the process, and any malicious activities can be detected and addressed in real-time.
