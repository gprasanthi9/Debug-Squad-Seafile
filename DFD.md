# Data Flow Diagram

## Part 1: Threat Modeling

### Introduction
As a team, we analyzed the core data flows and interactions within the Seafile environment to understand the system's strengths and potential weaknesses. Our **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** shows how critical components like the External Web Service, Sea Hub, Seafile Server, and Nginx Database communicate with each other. We focused on identifying threats in key areas like authentication, data protection, and service availability.

### Observations
From our threat modeling, we identified three main areas of focus:

#### 1. Authentication and Authorization
- We addressed **21 threats** with mitigations in place.
- MFA was a key solution to prevent unauthorized access.
- Ensuring robust authentication methods is critical for system security.

#### 2. Data Protection
- **39 threats** require further investigation.
- Protecting data in transit and at rest is essential.

#### 3. Service Availability
- **6 threats** are yet to be mitigated.
- Service interruptions are a concern; stress testing is recommended.
- Ensuring reliability under high load is a priority.

#### 4. Security Gaps
We also identified areas that need improvement:
- **Cross-Site Scripting** protections need to be enhanced.
- **SQL Injection** prevention measures must be strengthened.
- Controls for resource consumption should be implemented to prevent DoS attacks.

### Summary
Overall, our analysis highlighted key vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies for the Seafile system. While progress has been made in areas like authentication and data protection, further investigation and effort are needed to address unresolved threats and security gaps. With a strong focus on implementing encryption protocols, enhancing service availability, and mitigating XSS and SQL injection threats, Seafile can significantly improve its overall security posture.

### Reflection
Working on this project, we realized the importance of understanding how data flows within a system and how vulnerabilities can arise at any point. Collaboration was key in identifying these issues and proposing actionable solutions. Misunderstandings about trust boundaries were resolved through brainstorming and documentation.

Moving forward, we plan to document all security requirements comprehensively.
