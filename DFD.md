**Justification:** .\

  **Finding** - We found input obfuscation is reasonably accounted for, and MFA exists within the software yet it is optional. It would be recommended to change this to an 'Opt-out' instead of an 'Opt-in' feature.

## Reflection
The team collaborated effectively to identify these gaps and proposed actionable steps to resolve them. Misunderstandings about boundaries and security mechanisms were addressed through discussions and brainstorming. Moving forward, we plan to document all security requirements and cross-reference them with the DFD to avoid similar gaps in future iterations.
