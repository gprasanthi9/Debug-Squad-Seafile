### 1.2 Secure Login (Erik Weinmeister)
 
![Assurance Case: File Upload/Download Security in Seafile](https://github.com/gprasanthi9/Debug-Squad-Seafile/blob/main/Assurance%20Case%20Diagram/LoginAssuranceCaseV2.jpg)

**Assessment:**  
Secure logins are provided with username and passwords. If users follow password policy they have the first level of protection.  If that is compromised the second layer of multi factor authentication via a key fob is providing protection.  In the case a user surrenders the password and the key fob, they are to report it.  When this is reported remote login is disabled and a password change is enacted.  The other avenue of a password spraying attack that would lead to mutiple prompts to the user for MFA, can lead to MFA fatigue.  This is when the user gets so many requests they just approve them.  The multiple failures in the logs from the spray attack will see a failure and should be looking for successes to trigger a account lockout, which will send an alert.

**Assessment:**  

The assurance case focuses on ensuring that the file version control system maintains file integrity, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures that proper version history is recorded. These claims pertain to the critical properties of security within a file version control system, which are essential for safeguarding against unauthorized file modifications and ensuring reliable access to previous versions.


**Supporting Arguments:**

1. **Sub-Claim (C1):** File Integrity is Maintained Across Versions.  
   This claim asserts that file integrity is ensured as the system tracks and logs changes to files.

   **Evidence:** System logs confirming file version integrity.
   Logs provide a comprehensive trail of file changes, ensuring that any unauthorized or accidental changes are detectable.

2. **Sub-Claim (C2):** Version History is Stored Correctly
   Proper versioning and access controls prevent any misrepresentation or loss of the file history.

   **Evidence:** Version history audit reports.
   These reports validate the accuracy and completeness of the file version history.

3. **Sub-Claim (C3):** Logs and Audits Ensure No Tampering
   Ensuring audit trails and logs have not been altered is critical in maintaining trust in the system.

   **Evidence:** Audit procedure compliance documents.
   Compliance documents serve as proof that the logging mechanism is trustworthy and tamper-proof.

4. **Sub-Claim (C4):** Network Connectivity Ensures Version Upload Consistency
   A stable and secure network ensures file versions are uploaded without corruption or errors.

   **Evidence:** System monitoring network logs confirming connectivity.
   Logs demonstrate the networkâ€™s reliability during uploads, ensuring no data loss occurs during version updates.

5. **Sub-Claim (C5):** User Permissions Are Validated Before Uploads
   Uploading new file versions is restricted to authorized users, ensuring security controls prevent unauthorized file changes.

   **Evidence:** System checks validating user permissions.
   Permissions systems and checks prevent unauthorized users from altering or uploading versions.

### 1.5 Data Synchronization  (Gutta Prasanthi)
<img width="1097" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/494196b9-d4c0-404d-b288-b820677ff5f3">


**Assessment:**  
The Assurance Case for secure data synchronization in Seafile demonstrates a well-structured approach to ensuring data security through encryption (TLS), authentication, and error logging. The available evidence supports key claims, such as the use of TLS for data encryption and the implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) to mitigate credential compromise risks. However, there are gaps in evidence, particularly in areas like regular verification of encryption updates, testing of synchronization error detection under various conditions, and user credential management processes. Addressing these gaps would further strengthen the assurance of data security and resilience against potential threats.
