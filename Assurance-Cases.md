**Diagram:**  
![Diagram link](https://github.com/gprasanthi9/Debug-Squad-Seafile/blob/Kunle/Assurance%20Case%20Diagram/Assurance%20Case_File%20Share.jpg)

**Assessment:**  


Seafile effectively minimizes the risk of unauthorized access to shared files during collaboration by enforcing a robust user authentication and authorization policy. This ensures that only authorized individuals can access and modify sensitive data, reducing the likelihood of a data breach. To further protect users' credentials, Seafile implements **[AES-256 encryption](https://help.seafile.com/security_and_encryption/use_encrypted_libraries/#:~:text=If%20you%20use%20web%20app,be%20found%20at%20Seafile%20Manual)** along with 1000 iterations of the **[SHA256 hash function](https://manual.seafile.com/security/security_features/)**, making it nearly impossible for attackers to hijack passwords through brute force or other common attack methods. Additionally, Seafile enhances its security with two-factor authentication **[2FA](https://manual.seafile.com/maintain/two_factor_authentication/)**, adding an extra layer of protection by requiring users to provide a second verification factor, significantly lowering the risk of unauthorized file access even if passwords are compromised.

- **Top-Level Claim (C1):** Seafile minimizes unauthorized disclosure of files during collaborative activities.
- **Context (CT1):** Seafile supports file lock.

### Supporting Arguments:

**Sub-Claims and evidence and others:**
- **Sub-Claim C1:** File access requires user Authentication
- **Sub-Claim C3:** Users' credentials are hashed 
- **Sub-Claim C4:** Seafile uses 2FA for file sharing
- **Sub-Claim C5:** Latest Seafile version supports 2FA

**Rebuttal:**
   - **R1:** Unless there is no proper access control.
   - **R2:** Unless The user's credentials are unprotected.
   - **R3:** Unless The system uses only passwords for authentication.
  
**Undermine**
   - **UM1:** Unless the version does not support 2FA

### 1.2 Secure Login (Erik Weinmeister)
 
![Assurance Case: File Upload/Download Security in Seafile](https://github.com/gprasanthi9/Debug-Squad-Seafile/blob/main/Assurance%20Case%20Diagram/LoginAssuranceCaseV2.jpg)

**Assessment:**  
Secure logins are provided with username and passwords. If users follow password policy they have the first level of protection.  If that is compromised the second layer of multi factor authentication via a key fob is providing protection.  In the case a user surrenders the password and the key fob, they are to report it.  When this is reported remote login is disabled and a password change is enacted.  The other avenue of a password spraying attack that would lead to mutiple prompts to the user for MFA, can lead to MFA fatigue.  This is when the user gets so many requests they just approve them.  The multiple failures in the logs from the spray attack will see a failure and should be looking for successes to trigger a account lockout, which will send an alert.


- **Top-Level Claim (C1):** Seafile Secure Login.
- **Context (CT1):** Seafile users are normal (non-technical).
- **Rebuttal (R1):** Unless User is not following password policy
**Supporting Arguments:**
1.	**Sub-Claim (C2):** MFA prevents password compromise.
