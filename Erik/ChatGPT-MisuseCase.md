### Misuse Case: Password Guessing by a Script Kiddie

#### Description
A script kiddie attempts to gain unauthorized access to a user account by using automated tools to guess passwords. They might leverage common password lists or simple brute-force techniques to exploit weak password policies.

#### Actor
- **Script Kiddie**: An individual with limited technical skills who uses existing scripts or tools to perform attacks, often without a deep understanding of the underlying technologies.

### Recommendations to Mitigate Password Guessing

1. **Implement Account Lockout Mechanisms**
   - Lock the account after a defined number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts).
   - Notify users when their accounts are locked and provide a secure way to unlock them.

2. **Enforce Strong Password Policies**
   - Require complex passwords that include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Implement minimum and maximum password length requirements (e.g., 12-16 characters).

3. **Use CAPTCHA on Login Forms**
   - Implement CAPTCHA challenges after a certain number of failed login attempts to differentiate between human users and automated scripts.

4. **Monitor and Log Login Attempts**
   - Keep detailed logs of login attempts, noting the IP addresses, timestamps, and whether the attempts were successful or not.
   - Set up alerts for unusual patterns, such as multiple failed attempts from the same IP address.

5. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Require an additional verification step (e.g., SMS code, authenticator app) after entering a password, making it significantly harder for attackers to gain access.

6. **Use Rate Limiting**
   - Throttle login attempts from the same IP address over a short period to slow down automated guessing attacks.

7. **Educate Users About Password Security**
   - Provide guidance on creating strong passwords and the importance of not reusing passwords across different accounts.
   - Encourage the use of password managers to help users manage complex passwords.

8. **Regularly Update Password Storage Mechanisms**
   - Use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) to store passwords securely.
   - Implement salting to protect against rainbow table attacks.

9. **Deploy IP Blacklisting/Whitelisting**
   - Temporarily block IP addresses after a certain number of failed attempts.
   - Consider allowing only known IP addresses for sensitive accounts.

10. **Conduct Regular Security Audits**
    - Periodically review and test the effectiveness of security measures against password guessing attacks, adjusting policies and practices as needed.

By implementing these recommendations, organizations can significantly reduce the risk posed by password guessing attempts from script kiddies and enhance overall account security.
