/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.
/Users/shreeyanreddy/IdeaProjects/seafile-server/seafile-server/LICENSE.txt:You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
