# SEAFILE CODE REVIEW FOR SECURITY RISKS ASSESSMENT
**Date:** December 9, 2024  
**Project:** Seafile Server  
**Focus:** Seafile-server  
**Repository:** [Seafile-server GitHub](https://github.com/haiwen/seafile-server)  

## 5. ‚Å†INSUFFICIENT CREDENTIAL PROTECTION (CWE-522)
**Location:** `server/user-mgr.c`  
**Location Link:** [View Code](https://github.com/haiwen/seafile-server/blob/master/common/user-mgr.c#L802)  
**Risk Level:** High  
**Found In Code:** `hash_password_pbkdf2_sha256 (const char *passwd, ...`  

### Details:
 -  Weak Password Storage Mechanisms: The hashing implementation lacks the use of sufficient iterations or 
    salts for added protection.
 -  Inadequate Encryption Implementation: The encryption approach does not meet modern security standards.
 -  Insufficient Protection of Stored Credentials: Password hashes could be susceptible to brute-force 
    attacks.
 -  Potential Password Hash Exposure: Weakly hashed passwords increase the risk of exposure if attackers 
    gain access to the database.

### Code Context and Manual Inspection:

### Line 802:
    hash_password_pbkdf2_sha256 (const char *passwd, ...
 
 The function hashes user passwords but may not sufficiently protect against brute force or dictionary 
 attacks.

**Observations**

 -  **Use of PBKDF2:** PBKDF2 is used for hashing but might lack sufficient iterations or strong salts.

 -  **Key Vulnerability:** The hash may not meet modern standards for securing credentials.

### Proposed Fix:

1. **Update the Hashing Algorithm:**

     - Use a more secure configuration of PBKDF2:

       - Increase the number of iterations to 100,000 or more (current security standard).
       - Use a unique, randomly generated salt for each user.
   
2. **Sample Updated Code:**
   
        hash_password_pbkdf2_sha256(const char *passwd, const char *salt, int iterations) {
        // Use a strong salt and at least 100,000 iterations
        PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC_SHA256(passwd, strlen(passwd), (unsigned char *)salt, strlen(salt), iterations, key_length, output);}

4. **Additional Steps:**
- Store only the hashed password and salt in the database, never the plaintext password.
- Use a cryptographically secure random number generator for salt generation.

### Result - True Positive
This is a valid vulnerability (CWE-522) where the current password protection mechanism could be enhanced to meet modern security requirements.


### Recommendations:

1. **Enhance the Hashing Algorithm:**
    - Upgrade PBKDF2 configuration to include higher iterations and unique salts.
2. **Regular Security Audits:**
    - Perform periodic reviews of cryptographic implementations to ensure compliance with updated security 
      standards.
3. **Adopt Secure Credential Storage Guidelines:**
    - Follow best practices like those outlined by OWASP for password storage.
