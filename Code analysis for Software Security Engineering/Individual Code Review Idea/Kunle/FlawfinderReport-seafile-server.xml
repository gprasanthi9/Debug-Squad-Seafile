FINAL RESULTS:

seafile-server\lib\utils.c:2078:  [5] (race) readlink:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files or
  change the link content, a race condition results. Also, it does not
  terminate with ASCII NUL. (CWE-362, CWE-20). Reconsider approach.
seafile-server\common\cdc\cdc.c:92:  [4] (crypto) crypt:
  The crypt functions use a poor one-way hashing algorithm; since they only
  accept passwords of 8 characters or fewer and only a two-byte salt, they
  are excessively vulnerable to dictionary attacks given today's faster
  computing equipment (CWE-327). Use a different algorithm, such as SHA-256,
  with a larger, non-repeating salt.
seafile-server\common\cdc\cdc.c:114:  [4] (crypto) crypt:
  The crypt functions use a poor one-way hashing algorithm; since they only
  accept passwords of 8 characters or fewer and only a two-byte salt, they
  are excessively vulnerable to dictionary attacks given today's faster
  computing equipment (CWE-327). Use a different algorithm, such as SHA-256,
  with a larger, non-repeating salt.

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
